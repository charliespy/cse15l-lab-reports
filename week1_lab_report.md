# Welcome to ieng6 Remote Server Tutorial!

This is the first of a magnum opus series, *CSE 15L Lab Reports*, written by our own UCSD student Charlie Sun. In this tutorial, he is going to lead you through the three steps of logging into a course-specific account on __ieng6__. 

## 1 - Installing VScode
VScode is a popular programming text editor all around the world. To start off, go to [this link](code.visualstudio.com), and follow the instructions to donwload and install the application on your machine. Be care of of the version you download (Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux)!

When it is installed, you should be able to open it and see something like this:

Yay! You have completed the first step!


## 2 - Remotely Connecting
Another thing we must install, if you're on Windos, is git bash. Go to [this link](https://gitforwindows.org/) and install git bash on your computer. Once installed, follow the instructions on [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994) to set your default terminal on VScode as git bash. 

Next, to access `ssh`, open a new terminal on VScode and type the following command, but with the zz replaced by your own account characters. 
```
ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
